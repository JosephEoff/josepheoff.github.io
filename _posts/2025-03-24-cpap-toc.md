Where medical necessity meets hobby.

I have mentioned before in passing that I have [sleep apnea.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sleep_apnea)  Things have sort of come to a head in the last few months, making me have to take a more active role in managing the treatment for the apnea.  That more active role starts with making the straps for the mask more comfortable, and carries over into helping improve the [open source software (OSCAR)](https://www.sleepfiles.com/OSCAR/) that I use to analyse the sleep data that my LÃ¶wenstein prisma SMART CPAP machine records each night.

This post is a collecting place for all the things I've been doing to improve my sleep.  It isn't in any kind of order. That matches the way things go around here - any which way it takes to get it done.  Some of the titles won't be obviously CPAP connected because they weren't originally written as CPAP posts - they were about other things that happen to touch on the CPAP.

1. [Sewing knit jersey material on a vintage straight stitch sewing machine - A simple sewing project using knit fabric sewn on a vibrating shuttle sewing machine](vibratingshuttle-jersey-2) - A simple project - if you can sew jersey fabric.
2. [Making a more comfortable set of head gear for my mask](cpapmaskstraps) - No stretch but soft.
3. [Making use of an inexpensive pulse oximeter](pulseoximeter) - Not a necessity, but certainly useful.
