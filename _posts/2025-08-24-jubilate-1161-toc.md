Fixing up a radio for my brother-in-law.

I wrote several blog posts about the [Blaupunkt Granada tube radio](1blaupunkt20300-toc) that I fixed up for my wife.  In one of the blog posts, I mentioned that my brother-in-law had used it for a while before parking it back at his parent's house, from which my wife and I retrieved it for her to use.

My brother-in-law has decided that he likes the sound of the old tube radios, so he bought a Telefunken Jubilate 1161 tube radio to replace the Granada that he gave up years ago.

Since we "swiped" the Granada from him, I figured the least I could do was to make sure his new old radio is working properly.
